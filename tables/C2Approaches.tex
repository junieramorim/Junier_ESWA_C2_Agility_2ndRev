	\hline	
	Edge C2 & All elements are connected to everyone with maximum information sharing & Fully Connected \\[5ex]
	Collaborative C2 & The resources are shared within subgroups; entities interdependence; suitable to holistic problems that can not be fully decomposed; peer-to-peer communication & Star + Fully connected \\[5ex]
	Coordinated C2 & Suitable to problems that can be fully decomposed; share necessary information to execute what was defined & Star \\[5ex]
	De-Conflicted C2 & The situation can be decomposed with no cross impact; sub-optimized; not suitable to dynamic scenarios & Ring \\[5ex]
	Conflicted C2 & No communication between entities & Isolated \\[1ex]
