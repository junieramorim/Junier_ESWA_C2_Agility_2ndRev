abstract = {Autonomous robots have a great potential to help in disaster scenarios. Nevertheless, each robot is faced with the variety of these scenarios and the difficulties of cooperation with heterogeneous robots and human actors of other rescue forces. Furthermore, approaches using predefined adaptation models are not flexible enough for these scenarios. Therefore, we propose an adaptive configuration of the information processing to enable the collaboration of heterogeneous groups. We present two contributions in this paper: a) An ontology to describe the semantics of information processing components and the structure of information, b) The composition of these components to an adaptation model at run-time. To coordinate the information sharing and integration of new discovered information sources at run-time, we further provide a general framework. Finally, we describe how to apply our approach in a fictitious scenario.},

@article{MPL-03,
	Abstract = {Context
Complex software-intensive systems comprise many subsystems that are often based on heterogeneous technological platforms and managed by different organizational units. Multi product lines (MPLs) are an emerging area of research addressing variability management for such large-scale or ultra-large-scale systems. Despite the increasing number of publications addressing MPLs the research area is still quite fragmented.
Objective
The aims of this paper are thus to identify, describe, and classify existing approaches supporting MPLs and to increase the understanding of the underlying research issues. Furthermore, the paper aims at defining success-critical capabilities of infrastructures supporting MPLs.
Method
Using a systematic literature review we identify and analyze existing approaches and research issues regarding MPLs. Approaches described in the literature support capabilities needed to define and operate MPLs. We derive capabilities supporting MPLs from the results of the systematic literature review. We validate and refine these capabilities based on a survey among experts from academia and industry.
Results
The paper discusses key research issues in MPLs and presents basic and advanced capabilities supporting MPLs. We also show examples from research approaches that demonstrate how these capabilities can be realized.
Conclusions
We conclude that approaches supporting MPLs need to consider both technical aspects like structuring large models and defining dependencies between product lines as well as organizational aspects such as distributed modeling and product derivation by multiple stakeholders. The identified capabilities can help to build, enhance, and evaluate MPL approaches.},

	Abstract = {The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) defines an SPL as a set of software-intensive systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission. A fundamental principle of SPLs is variability management, which involves separating the product line into three parts - common components, parts common to some but not all products, and individual products with their own specific requirements - and managing these throughout development. Using SPLs seeks to maximize reusable variation and eliminate wasteful generic development of components used only once. Although traditional SPL engineering recognizes that variation points are bound at different stages of development, and possibly also at runtime, it typically binds variation points before delivery of the software. In contrast, DSPL engineers typically aren't concerned with pre-runtime variation points. However, they recognize that in practice mixed approaches might be viable, where some variation points related to the environment's static properties are bound before runtime and others related to the dynamic properties are bound at runtime.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Information systems of the future will have to perform well within ever-changing organizational environments. Unfortunately, existing software development methodologies (object-oriented, structured or otherwise) have traditionally been inspired by programming concepts, not organizational ones, leading to a semantic gap between the software system and its operational environment. To reduce this gap, we propose a software development methodology named Tropos which is founded on concepts used to model early requirements. Our proposal adopts the i∗ organizational modeling framework, which offers the notions of actor, goal and (actor) dependency, and uses these as a foundation to model early and late requirements, architectural and detailed design. The paper outlines Tropos phases through an e-business example, and sketches a formal language which underlies the methodology and is intended to support formal analysis. The methodology seems to complement well proposals for agent-oriented programming platforms.},

	Annote = {- Dependability: em DSPL durante configura{\c c}{\~o}es em tempo de execu{\c c}{\~a}o (confiabilidade de um software. Primordial em sistemas cr{\'\i}ticos)
- Inclui disponibilidade, confiabilidade, seguran{\c c}a, integridade e manutenibilidade
- Aplica{\c c}{\~o}es desenvolvidas como DSPL, adicionando/removendo features em tempo de execu{\c c}{\~a}o
- Em SPL, para cada configura{\c c}{\~a}o do sistema temos uma nova medi{\c c}{\~a}o da confiabilidade (dependability) independente
- EM DSPL, al{\'e}m dessa an{\'a}lise, {\'e} necess{\'a}rio verificar os diferentes  contextos, identificando se ao menos uma configura{\c c}{\~a}o gerada pelo DSPL atende aos requisitos de confiabilidade.

=> Mudan{\c c}as no contexto e nos objetivos: impactos na DSPL

-maintainability: o sistema consegue refletir as mudan{\c c}as no contexto

- Reconfigura{\c c}{\~a}o do sistema em tempo muito curto (30ms) - DSPL

=> SPL: conjunto de softwares que compartilham um conjunto comum e gerenciado de features e que satisfazem a um conjunto de necessidades espec{\'\i}fico.
	- gerenciamento da variabilidade
	- Domain Model (descreve features), Feature Model e CK(Configuration Knowledge)


=> DSPL: permite a varia{\c c}{\~a}o do software em tempo de execu{\c c}{\~a}o atendendo {\`a}s novas necessidades do usu{\'a}rio e/ou do contexto
	- arquitetura: MAPE-K (Monitoring detectando eventos, Analysis avaliando os impactos das mudan{\c c}as no sistema, Planning as adapta{\c c}{\~o}es necess{\'a}rias, Execution o planejamento de adapta{\c c}{\~a}o and Knowledge para repetir e manter esse loop de opera{\c c}{\~o}es)
	- Foco em DSPL orientada a objetivos (goal-oriented)

=> Sistema exemplo (BSN-DSPL) Body Sensor Network
	- Uma rede de sensores que capturam sinais vitais de um indiv{\'\i}duo e envia para um sistema central analisar, podendo identificar situa{\c c}{\~o}es cr{\'\i}ticas de sa{\'u}de.
	- Caso a sa{\'u}de esteja boa, alguns sensores podem ser desligados (economia de energia)
	- Sistema orientado a Quality Goal
	
Requisitos:
=> Reliability: a reconfigura{\c c}{\~a}o feita pelo DSPL deve atender os requisitos do quality goal com confiabilidade

=> Maintainability: Com os diferentes n{\'\i}veis corporais dos indiv{\'\i}duos, o sistema precisa ter bom n{\'\i}vel de manutenabilidade para adequar-se aos novos padr{\~o}es

Analisar a confiabilidade em SPL
=> Nr grande de produtos de software
=> variability-aware (conhecimento da variabilidade) que permite reaproveitar esfor{\c c}os de an{\'a}lises em diversos produtos de software

=> Os produtos de sofwtare seguem uma cadeia de markov (modelo estoc{\'a}stico atrav{\'e}s de valores discretos que dependem apenas do estado atual)

---------

Domain Engineering => ocorre estaticamente em tempo de desenvolvimento
Application Engineering => ocorre dinamicamente em tempo de execu{\c c}{\~a}o para adaptar-se {\`a}s mudan{\c c}as de contexto e objetivos esperados.

Feature=> caracter{\'\i}stica distingu{\'\i}vel e relevante em um sistema para o stakeholder

Feature Modeling=> construct a domain model mapping all features and variability. Normalmente uma {\'a}rvore listando as features e como elas se relacionam e interdependem e se relacionam. Associam aos requisitos funcionais e n{\~a}o-funcionais. (Aten{\c c}{\~a}o para depend{\^e}ncias entre features)


DSL Specification => Conhecimento do contexto aprimorado ou mudan{\c c}as no contexto provocam altera{\c c}{\~o}es no n{\'\i}vel de confiabilidade do produto
DSPL orientado a objetivos (stakeholders needs and expectations)
As transi{\c c}{\~o}es entre estados precisam ser completas (evitar travamentos)


Architecture Design => permite o comportamento din{\^a}mico do DSPL

Mapeamento entre uma dada confiabilidade desejada (como objetivo) e a configura{\c c}{\~a}o que atende a esses requisitos.
=> Al{\'e}m de atender ao n{\'\i}vel de confiabilidade desejado, {\'e} necess{\'a}rio atender {\`a}s constraints do modelo de features (Feature Model). Isso {\'e} poss{\'\i}vel atrav{\'e}s das regras de reescrita do Feature Model.
=> Chamado de Constraint Satisfaction Problem. (CSP)

Al{\'e}m das atividades definidas pelo MAPE-K temos a atividade de redefini{\c c}{\~a}o do objetivo. (evolu{\c c}{\~a}o do conhecimento do dom{\'\i}nio)},

	Abstract = {The original formulation of SharedPlans by B. Grosz and C. Sidner (1990) was developed to provide a model of collaborative planning in which it was not necessary for one agent to have intentions-to toward an act of a different agent. Unlike other contemporaneous approaches (J.R. Searle, 1990), this formulation provided for two agents to coordinate their activities without introducing any notion of irreducible joint intentions. However, it only treated activities that directly decomposed into single-agent actions, did not address the need for agents to commit to their joint activity, and did not adequately deal with agents having only partial knowledge of the way in which to perform an action. This paper provides a revised and expanded version of SharedPlans that addresses these shortcomings. It also reformulates Pollack's (1990) definition of individual plans to handle cases in which a single agent has only partial knowledge; this reformulation meshes with the definition of SharedPlans. The new definitions also allow for contracting out certain actions. The formalization that results has the features required by Bratman's (1992) account of shared cooperative activity and is more general than alternative accounts (H. Levesque et al., 1990; E. Sonenberg et al., 1992).},

-Awareness-dial: this adjust the level of awareness and helps with the way that the team orginizes itself.

* global awareness => the group is aware that for all action, there is a pair of agents (i,j) where agent i is aware about j intention
* detailed awareness => for all actions in the plan, there is a pair of agents (i,j), such that the group is aware that  the agent i is committed to agent j to fullfill the action alfa

The different degrees of awareness is characterized in terms of different types of beliefs.

Dial: a manner to adjust the level of awareness (collective awareness)

The awareness dial will define the collective commitment level
   - negotiating and persuading one another who will do what.


Strongest type of group commitment: (1)robust collective Commitment
								
(2) Strong collective commitment (the group as a whole believes that things are under control)

(3) Weak collective commitment: there is no collective awareness about the plan correctness; the group does not know the plan details but still beleive that the thing are under control


Team commintment: the awareness-dial is putted in a way that the collective intention ensures that the team structure exists and the overall goal and composition of the team are commonly believed

The most simple structure is done by: one initiator element controls the team

Topologies:
1 - Robust Commitment + Single Initiator + Full Communication
2- Star Topology + Single Initiator + Restricted Communication
3- Ring topology + Single initiator (similar to swarm gap strategy - base article)
4- Hierarchical group (tree)

abstract = {This paper presents a general virtual ring method to design and analyze small-world structured P2P networks on the base topologies embedded in ID spaces with distance metric. Its basic idea is to abstract a virtual ring from the base topology according to the distance metric, then build small-world long links in the virtual ring and map the links back onto the real network to construct the small-world routing tables for achieving logarithmic greedy routing efficiency. Four properties are proposed to characterize the base topologies that can be turned into small-world by the virtual ring method. The virtual ring method is applied to the base topologies of d-torus with Manhattan distance, high dimensional d-torus base topologies, and other base topologies including the unbalanced d-torus and the ring topology with tree distance. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate the efficiency and the resilience of the proposed overlays.},

@inproceedings{SAS05,
abstract = {The development of self-adaptive software requires the engineering of proper feedback loops where an adaptation logic controls the underlying software. The adaptation logic often describes the adaptation by using runtime models representing the underlying software and steps such as analysis and planning that operate on these runtime models. To systematically address this interplay, runtime megamodels, which are specific runtime models that have themselves runtime models as their elements and that also capture the relationships between multiple runtime models, have been proposed. In this paper, we go one step further and present a modeling language for runtime megamodels that considerably eases the development of the adaptation logic by providing a domain-specific modeling approach and a runtime interpreter for this part of a self-adaptive system. This supports development by modeling the feedback loops explicitly and at a higher level of abstraction. Moreover, it permits to build complex solutions where multiple feedback loops interact or operate on top of each other, which is leveraged by keeping the megamodels explicit and alive at runtime and by interpreting them.},
annote = {Advantages:
(1) the feedback loops are explicitly described in the megamodels,
(2) the adaptation is specified at a higher level of abstraction in the megamodels by a number of model operations that work on runtime models, 
(3) the megamodels are kept alive at runtime and following an interpreter approach, the runtime models and the control flow between the model operations can be easily adapted at runtime, and 
(4) composing and especially the stacking of feedback loops resp. megamodels becomes possible without any need to build in specific sensors and effectors in between the megamodels.},

- Markov chain model most used to decision making process

- Architecture-based: uses a feedback loop with a runtime architecture model

- Software can change its structure(architecture X) or behavior(OK)

- QAQ - Quality Assessment Question

- The common element in all these limitations stems from the complex-ity of the problem, and the fact that over simplification of the cir-cumstances results in unrealistic problem statements that conse-quently create even more uncertainty in the system.

- Summary of answer to RQ1: Performance and cost are the most frequently addressed QAs; however, performance and reli-ability are the most commonly addressed individual QAs in pri-mary studies.

- The first is to use a certain model to express an indi-vidual QA, and its different characteristics. For instance, QA data variables and thresholds can be used to define different charac-teristics of performance (i.e., throughput and latency), or a utility function can be used both to express the QA characteristics, and also to support preferences of one characteristic over the other by using weights. The second is to use the same models to repre-sent the tradeoffs between multiple QAs in the entire system or certain system component. 
For instance, utility functions may be used to get the utility of each component in the system, and then the overall utility of the whole system, or discrete-time Markov chains may be used to represent system's behavior, which are sys-tem's states and related properties of interest and the probabili-ties of transitioning from one system state to another.

- Overall, our results indicate that existing approaches rarely consider priority of QAs.

With the emergence of highly configurable and evolvable systems, DSPLs have to cope with the evolution of their structural variability, i.e., The Feature Model (FM) used to derive the configuration. So far, little is known about the evolution of the FM while a configuration derived from this FM is running. In particular, such a dynamic evolution changes the DSPL configuration space, which is thus unsynchronized with the running configuration and its adaptation capabilities. In this position paper, we propose and describe an initial architecture to manage the dynamic evolution of DSPLs and their synchronization. In particular, we explain how this architecture supports the evolution of DSPLs based on FMs extended with cardinality and attributes, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been addressed yet.},

This paper presents a conceptual and methodological framework for formal modeling, validating, and verifying distributed self-adaptive systems. We show how MAPE-K loops for self adaptation can be naturally specified in an abstract stateful language like Abstract State Machines. In particular, we exploit the concept of multi-agent Abstract State Machines to specify decentralized adaptation control by using MAPE computations. We support techniques for validating and verifying adaptation scenarios, and getting feedback of the correctness of the adaptation logic as implemented by the MAPE-K loops. In particular, a verification technique based on meta-properties is proposed to allow discovering unwanted interferences between MAPE-K loops at the early stages of the system design. As a proof-of concepts, we model and analyze a traffic monitoring system.},

abstract = {Self-adaptive software (SAS) systems monitor their own behavior and autonomously make dynamic adjustments to maintain desired properties in response to changes in the systems' operational contexts. Control theory provides verifiable feedback models to realize this kind of autonomous control for a broad class of systems for which precise quantitative or logical discrete models can be defined. Recent MAPE-K models, along with variants such as the hierarchical ACRA, address a broader range of tasks. However, they do not provide the inherent assurance mechanisms that control theory does, as they do not explicitly identify and establish the properties that reliable controllers should have. These properties, in general, result not from the abstract models, but from the specifics of control strategies, which are precisely what these models fail to analyze. We show that, even for systems too complex for direct application of classical control theory, the abstractions of control theory provide design guidance that identifies important control characteristics and raises critical design issues about the details of the strategy that determine the controllability of the resulting systems. This in turn enables careful reasoning about whether the control characteristics are in fact achieved. In this chapter we examine the control theory approach, explain several control strategies illustrated with examples from both domains, classical control theory and SAS, and show how the issues addressed by these strategies can and should be seriously considered for the assurance of self-adaptive software systems. From this examination we distill challenges for developing principles that may serve as the basis of a control theory for the assurance of self-adaptive software systems.},

abstract = {Military Command and Control (C2) is the process by which commanders organize and employ force elements in order to achieve military objectives. This process needs to be represented in models of conflict in order to simulate realistic force behaviour and effectiveness. Since C2 is heavily influenced by human decision-making, modelling the C2 process is recognized as one of the most challenging areas for defence analysis. This paper describes on-going research into ways in which the effects of C2 can be incorporated successfully into constructive simulation models of combat. The research has developed a representation of C2 based on an intelligent agent framework in which the C2 processes of a military operation are carried out by a number of interacting command agents, representing the various military headquarters. An agent software architecture has been designed and implemented, along with algorithms for key C2 processes, namely (1) data fusion and recognized picture compilation, (2) decision-making and planning at operational and tactical levels, (3) plan supervision and repair. These have been implemented within two software testbeds - MOSES, a simulation of Operations Other Than War (OOTW) and CLARION+, an extension of CLARION, the UK land-air combat simulation.},

abstract = {Model-driven development (MDD) is an approach for supporting the development of software systems, in which high-level modeling artifacts drive the production of time and effort-consuming low-level artifacts, such as the source code. Previous studies of the MDD effectiveness showed that it significantly increases development productivity, because the development effort is focused on the business domain rather than technical issues. However, MDD was exploited in the context of agent-based development in a limited way, and most of the existing proposals demonstrated the effectiveness of using MDD in this context by argumentation or examples, lacking disciplined empirical analyses. In this paper, we explore the use of MDD for agent-based modeling and simulation in the adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) domain, in which autonomous agents are in charge of managing traffic light indicators to optimize traffic flow. We propose an MDD approach, composed of a modeling language and model-to-code transformations for producing runnable simulations automatically. In order to analyze the productivity gains of our MDD approach, we compared the amount of design and implementation artifacts produced using our approach and traditional simulation platforms. Results indicate that our approach reduces the workload to develop agent-based simulations in the ATSC domain.},

* detailed awareness ={\textgreater} for all actions in the plan, there is a pair of agents (i,j), such that the group is aware that the agent i is committed to agent j to fullfill the action alfa

The different degrees of awareness is characterized in terms of different types of beliefs.

Dial: a manner to adjust the level of awareness (collective awareness)

The awareness dial will define the collective commitment level
- negotiating and persuading one another who will do what.


Strongest type of group commitment: (1)robust collective Commitment

(2) Strong collective commitment (the group as a whole believes that things are under control)

(3) Weak collective commitment: there is no collective awareness about the plan correctness; the group does not know the plan details but still beleive that the thing are under control


Team commintment: the awareness-dial is putted in a way that the collective intention ensures that the team structure exists and the overall goal and composition of the team are commonly believed

The most simple structure is done by: one initiator element controls the team

Topologies:
1 - Robust Commitment + Single Initiator + Full Communication
2- Star Topology + Single Initiator + Restricted Communication
3- Ring topology + Single initiator (similar to swarm gap strategy - base article)

abstract = {Today software is the main enabler of many of the appliances and devices omnipresent in our daily life and important for our well being and work satisfaction. It is expected that the software works as intended, and that the software always and everywhere provides us with the best possible utility. This paper discusses the motivation, technical approach, and innovative results of the MUSIC project. MUSIC provides a comprehensive software development framework for applications that operate in ubiquitous and dynamic computing environments and adapt to context changes. Context is understood as any information about the user needs and operating environment which vary dynamically and have an impact on design choices. MUSIC supports several adaptation mechanisms and offers a model-driven application development approach supported by a sophisticated middleware that facilitates the dynamic and automatic adaptation of applications and services based on a clear separation of business logic, context awareness and adaptation concerns. The main contribution of this paper is a holistic, coherent presentation of the motivation, design, implementation, and evaluation of the MUSIC development framework and methodology.},
